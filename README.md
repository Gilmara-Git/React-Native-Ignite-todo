# About

This my First **React Native** challenge developed during my **Ignite bootcamp** with [Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/).

- This an an application to help you keep track of your to-do list.
- You can add a task or remove a task in your list
- You can toggle a task as completed/uncompleted
- There are 2 labels showing how many tasks are created and how many are completed
- Whenever a task is completed, there will be a change on its text style.
- There are validations to prevent entering duplicated or blank tasks.
- You are prompted to an alert message to confirm whenever you want to remove a task. 
##Beyond:
- Added a **congratulations** page whenever all tasks are marked as completed.
- Changed the icon that indicates a task has been completed to a **heart** icon.
- Disabled the **trash** button whenever a task is currently marked as completed.

# Motivation
